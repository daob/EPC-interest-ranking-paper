\begin{abstract}
Social science is often concerned with comparing groups such as countries, regions, time periods, the genders, or ethnicities.
Because such substantive comparisons may be threatened when measurement parameters differ across the groups, it is common practice to test the hypothesis of exact equality of measurement parameters across groups:  ``measurement invariance testing''. However, not all measurement differences are substantively relevant. At the same time,  not all substantively relevant differences are necessarily detected by the current best practices of invariance testing. Therefore, it was recently suggested in this journal to detect the relevant set of violations of measurement invariance using sensitivity analysis. This approach uses the ``EPC-interest'',  a measure of the change in the parameters of substantive interest due to violations of invariance. So far, however, EPC-interest was limited to continuous linear structural equation models and did not consider the impact of freeing several restrictions at the same time. 

Since categorical data are common in the social sciences and measurement invariance restrictions may be highly correlated, this paper extends the ``EPC-interest'' to models with categorical observed and latent variables. Moreover, we explicitly consider freeing (potentially large) sets of equality restrictions simultaneously. The advantages of the extended EPC-interest are demonstrated using a 48-country analysis of ``materialism / postmaterialism'' values measured by three partial ranking tasks using multilevel latent class regression. Some corroboration for hypotheses on postmaterialism from the literature are found when employing the EPC-interest, while without its application some of the findings contradict these hypotheses.

The newly developed methods discussed in this paper have been implemented in commercial software for latent variable modeling. Program inputs and data for the examples discussed in this article are provided in the electronic appendix (\url{http://}) [included as zip file in blinded version].

\section{Introduction}

\noindent
Ranking and paired comparisons data are central to political science, occurring for example when people rank candidates in ``ranked choice'' (``instant-runoff'') voting systems such as the Australian federal or London mayoral elections \citep[see e.g][]{karvonen2004preferential,toplak2010preferential},  choose from pairs of alternatives in a conjoint experiment \citep{hainmueller2014causal}, or rank their post-materialist value orientations in the World Values Survey \citep{inglehart1997modernization,inglehart2010changing}. 


Such procedures yield categorical and multivariate data, and, since they preclude certain joint outcomes, lead to complex dependencies that must be accounted for. 
Probabilistic models accounting for these characteristics go back at least to \citet{thurstone1927law}, who assumed choice utilities were independently normally distributed; \citet{mcfadden1974conditional} introduced a log-linear latent utility model that relaxes this assumption. Both of these approaches treat the choices as perfectly measured; however, rankings and choices may contain measurement error, without a ``true'' preference being available, so that latent variable models become necessary. 
\citet{maydeu2005structural} extended \citet{thurstone1927law}'s model to  multivariate outcomes incorporated into a structural equation modeling framework with latent variables \citep[see also][]{brown2011item,brown2012fitting};  \citet{jackson1980factor} described an earlier approach but did not account for the fact that choice data are categorical. \citet{bockenholt2002comparison}  extended \citet{mcfadden1974conditional}'s model to include discrete latent variables with an arbitrary distribution --  ``latent class'' variables. 

When the results of ranking tasks are compared across countries or other groups, not only measurement error, but also ``measurement equivalence''  \citep{steenkamp_assessing_1998,vandenberg2000review,schmitt2008measurement} becomes a concern. Inglehart's ``(post)materialism'' ranking tasks, for example, are often compared across countries to evaluate substantive theories on human values \citep[e.g.][]{inglehart1997modernization}. Such country comparisons may be threatened by cross-country differences in the way respondents' ranking choices measure ``(post)materialism''. In other words, ``measurement equivalence'' means  that conclusions of substantive interest should be uncontaminated by measurement differences \citep{oberski2012comparability}. To date, however, no studies have evaluated whether ranking choices are comparable across countries in the sense that parameters of interest are unaffected by possible measurement differences.

In this study, we apply a recently developed measure for this purpose, the ``EPC-interest'' \citep{Oberski:WP:EPC-interest}, to a nonparametric multilevel latent variable model for ranking data. This ``multilevel latent class'' \citep{vermunt2003multilevel} model for ranks or paired comparisons extends \citet{bockenholt2002comparison}'s model  to include multiple groups and a nonparametric random effect \citep{moors2007heterogeneity}. The  model is applied to 2010 World Values Survey data from 48 countries to evaluate whether latent (post)materialism classes are associated with GDP per capita and percentage of women in a country's parliament, as suggested by values theory. The ``EPC-interest''  measure then approximates the change in these substantive parameters of interest that would be observed if measurement equivalence restrictions were freed. 
It is therefore a sensitivity analysis approach to measurement equivalence \citep{Oberski:WP:EPC-interest}; \citet[p. 12]{schoot2013facing} argued that it can be seen  as providing a specific definition of ``approximate measurement invariance'' \citep[see][for other approaches]{muthen2012bayesian,muthen2014alignment}.
Since the EPC-interest was originally developed for the case of equality restrictions in linear structural equation models with continuous data, we extend the EPC-interest measure here to include categorical observed and latent variables. 

The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, contrary to existing uses of these data, we allow for measurement error in the (post)materialism ranking tasks. Moreover, no assumptions about the distribution of these errors or the underlying scale are necessary. Second, we evaluate whether the 48 countries in the 2010 World Values Survey can be compared for the purpose of looking at the relationship between (post)materialism and correlates central to \citet{inglehart1997modernization}'s theory. Third, we develop the EPC-interest measure for latent class analysis, i.e. for models with discrete observed and latent variables. This development allows for more general application of the EPC-interest approach to measurement equivalence evaluation, for example in IRT analysis \citep[see also][]{Oberski:WP:model-based-GOF}, paired comparisons data, or ordinal factor analysis.

%The logic of measurement invariance testing is that groups may safely be compared when their measurement parameters are exactly equal: in that case, conclusions of substantive interest are uncontaminated by measurement differences. While this logic is sound, it does not follow that comparison is never warranted when measurement parameters are not exactly equal. Moreover, in practical applications exact equality is not often plausible. These observations have led to the concept of ``approximate'' measurement  invariance, in which a certain, ``small'' amount of non-invariance is permitted. 
%``Approximate'' has in the past been taken to correspond to model fit in terms of CFI, RMSEA and other relative fit measures, while more recently Bayesian priors on group differences and the alignment method were introduced. 
%However, while these methods ensure that measurement differences are ``small'', even ``small'' measurement differences could, in principle, still contaminate the conclusions of interest. Conversely, those measurement differences allowed for may not necessarily affect the conclusions of interest.

The data used here came  from the 2010--2012 World Values Survey\footnote{\url{http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/}} (WVS)   and included $n = 67^,568$ respondents in 48 different countries (Appendix \ref{sec:countries-included} provides a full list of countries).
The WVS questionnaire includes \citet{inglehart1977silent}'s extended post-materialism questions, developed to measure political values priorities. This extended version includes three sets of four values (Table \ref{tab:ranking-question}). Of these, set B in Table \ref{tab:ranking-question} is known as the ``short scale'' that is commonly used in research on values priorities.  Two of the values in each set are intended to measure  ``materialist'' concerns while the two remaining values indicate ``postmaterialist'' political goals; for each of the   three sets, WVS respondents are then asked to rank their first and second priorities. 




%Inglehart labels the latter goals as post-materialist to indicate that the priority of these goals increases when materialist goals are established and hence drop in priority level in the given set. 

Postmaterialism theory has been founded on the dual-hypotheses model \citep[p. 881]{inglehart1981post}. The first hypothesis holds that an individual's priority set reflects the socio-economic environment because one attaches relatively more importance to scarce objects. This scarcity hypothesis is complemented by a socialization hypothesis that stresses the importance of experiences in the `formative' years. The latter hypothesis constitutes the heart of the argument regarding generational differences in political priorities since it indicates that, in reaching adulthood, values tend to crystallize in personality. By a process of social metabolism, society gradually changes from  materialist to postmaterialist. %The socialization hypothesis is crucial in understanding generational differences. The socio-economic proposition on the other hand gains momentum when comparing different cultures. 

In line with the scarcity hypothesis, \citet{inglehart1997modernization} and \citet{inglehart2010changing} argued that socio-economic development indicators per country such as GDP per capita correlate strongly with aggregated scores of self-expression values. 
Moreover, in line with the socialization hypothesis, associations of aggregated values priorities with socio-cultural variations across countries such as religious heritage and gender equality have been found by \citet{inglehart2002gender}. In short, substantive interest in this literature focuses on the associations between (post)materialism and both socio-economic and socio-cultural country-level aggregates. In this study we will therefore following these authors by examining the aggregate relationship of values priorities and by using GDP per capita and the percentage of women in parliament to represent socio-economic and socio-cultural correlates of values, respectively. These country-level variables were obtained from the World Bank database\footnote{\url{http://data.worldbank.org/}} using the \texttt{WDI} package \citep{arel2013WDI} in \texttt{R 3.0.2} \citep{Rlanguage}.


In their previous work, Inglehart and colleagues examined these relationships of interest between value priorities and country-level covariates by creating an observed categorization of the ranking choices into three groups:  ``materialist'', ``postmaterialist'' and ``mixed''. These groups are defined \emph{a priori}, and their usage as observed variables implies that a complete absence of measurement error is assumed. It also implies that no differences in measurement exist across the countries to be compared. In other words, any comparison of the created categories over countries is assumed to be fully due to substantive rather than measurement differences. The contribution of  this study to the values priorities literature is to relax the assumption of zero measurement error, examine empirically whether three class can adequately represent the data, and apply the EPC-interest procedure to examine the implicit claim of full cross-country invariance of these measures. 




\section{Model}


To examine differences in (post)materialism with respect to GDP per capita and the proportion of women in parliament, we develop a latent variable model for ranking data. The advantages of this approach are that there is no need to establish a priori rules for combining the three ranking tasks into a measure of ``postmaterialism''; that it does not presuppose a fixed number of ``postmaterialism'' classes; that it allows for measurement error in ``postmaterialism''; and that it allows for an examination of the impact of violations of measurement invariance on the conclusions of interest. 
There are several approaches to modeling ranking data. We adopt a sequential approach originally due to \citet{luce1959individual} and \citet{mcfadden1974conditional}. A single-level latent variable  version of these models was described by \citet{bockenholt2002comparison}; \citet{moors2007heterogeneity} applied a multilevel latent class model for rankings to European Values Study data on postmaterialism. Different approaches to modeling ranking data using latent variables can be found in
\citet{maydeu2005structural} and \citet{brown2011item,brown2012fitting}. 

The ranking model departs by describing the joint probability of observing choice $A_1 = a_1$ on set A (see Table \ref{tab:ranking-question}) for first place  and $A_2 = a_2$ for second place as 
\begin{equation}
	P(A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2 | X = x) = 
		\frac{\omega_{a_1 x}}{\sum_{k} \omega_{k x}}
		\frac{\omega_{a_2 x}}{\sum_{k \neq a_1}
			\omega_{k x}},
				\label{eq:ranking}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{k x}$ is the utility ($0<\omega_{k x}<1$) of response option $k$ \citep{mcfadden1974conditional}. Crucially, the choice for second place, $A_2$, is modeled while excluding the alternative already chosen for first place, $A_1$. In other words, we model a sequential ranking process in which first place is chosen first, then second place is chosen from the remaining options.
This makes the model used here different from standard models for categorical data.
 The utilities $\omega_{kx}$ may differ over persons due to the latent class variable $X$ \citep[pp. 171--3]{bockenholt2002comparison}, which in our case will represent ``(post)materialism''. This latent class variable is typically chosen to have a fixed number of categories, $T$. To restrict the utilities to their allowed range and facilitate model interpretation, it is convenient instead of the utilities $\omega_{kx}$ to estimate the log-linear parameters,
\begin{equation}
	\ln \omega_{k x} = \tau_{k} + \lambda_{k x}.\label{eq:loglin-measurement}
\end{equation}
For identification, we set $\sum_k \tau_{k} = \sum_{k} \lambda_{kx} = \sum_{x} \lambda_{kx} = 0$. Using this ``effects coding''  \citep{vermunt2013technical},  the $9 (T - 1)$ attribute parameters $\lambda_{k x}$ can then be interpreted as the deviation from option $k$'s average log-utility in latent class $x$.



Primary interest focuses on how the probabilities of belonging to these latent (post)materialism classes differ as a function of the country-level covariates log-GDP per capita ($Z_1$) and percentage of women in parliament ($Z_2$).  At the same time, it has become common practice to control for country effects using a multilevel approach. We therefore model the latent class probabilities using the multinomial logistic regression
\begin{equation}
P(X = x| Z_1 = z_1, Z_2 = z_2, G = g) = \frac{\exp(\alpha_x + \gamma_{1x} z_1 +\gamma_{2x} z_2  + \beta_{gx})}
					{\sum_t \exp(\alpha_t + \gamma_{1t} z_1 +  \gamma_{2t} z_2 +  + \beta_{tg})},
					\label{eq:regression}
\end{equation}
where the country-level latent variable $G$ has been introduced. The country-level effects $\beta_{tx}$ in Equation \ref{eq:regression} could be modeled as normal, leading to a standard multilevel model. However, since in the past very differing classes of countries have been observed \citep{moors2007heterogeneity}, making the normality assumption rather implausible, we instead take $G$ to be a country-level latent class variable with $S$ classes and a freely estimated distribution. This nonparametric model was introduced as the ``multilevel latent class regression'' model by \citet{vermunt2003multilevel}. The main parameters of substantive interest in Equation \ref{eq:regression} are the $2  (T - 1)$ logistic regression coefficients $\gamma_{mx}$.


%, of which there are , where $T$ is the number of latent postmaterialism ($X$) classes. 
%It may also be of interest to derive the posterior probability for each country, $P(X | \text{country}) = \sum_{i \in \text{country}} P(Y | X) P(X) / \sum_X P(Y | X)$ for visual display purposes.

Combining the three ranking tasks, each modeled according to Equation \ref{eq:ranking}, with the multilevel latent class regression model in Equation \ref{eq:regression} leads to the casewise likelihood
\begin{multline}
L(\param) = 
	P(A_1, A_2, 
		B_1, B_2, 
		C_1, C_2 | Z_1, Z_2) = \\
	\sum_{G} P(G)	\sum_{X} P(X | Z_1, Z_2, G)
				P(A_1, A_2 | X)
				P(B_1, B_2 | X) 
				P(C_1, C_2 | X),
				\label{eq:lik}
\end{multline}
where the realizations of variables have been dropped for clarity, and $\param$ is a vector collecting the $-3 + T (11 + S) $ free parameters of the model.
Note that values of the within-country variables $X, A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1$, and $C_2$ may differ over persons, whereas the between-country variables $G, Z_1$, and $Z_2$ can differ only over countries. 


\begin{figure}\centering

	\caption{\label{fig:model}Graphical representation of 
	the multilevel latent class regression model for 
	(post)materialism measured by three partial ranking tasks. Observed variables are shown in rectangles while unobserved (``latent'') variables are shown in ellipses.	}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:model} shows a graphical representation of the model in Equation \ref{eq:lik}. 
The parameters of primary substantive interest are the effect-coded logistic regression coefficients for the effect of GDP per capita and percentage of women in parliament on the latent postmaterialism class (the stronger line labeled $\gamma$ in Figure \ref{fig:model}). 
These effects of interest are controlled for the country random effects. Since these are modeled using a latent class variable, the top part of the model in Figure \ref{fig:model} is a multilevel latent class regression. The gray arrows between indicators within the same set are meant to show that a fixed conditional relationship is specified between the first and second choice within each set (Equation \ref{eq:ranking}). 

Equation \ref{eq:lik} is, in fact, a full invariance model: it excludes potential violations of ``scalar''  and ``metric'' measurement invariance. These can be conceptualized as, respectively, a direct main effect and a direct interaction effect of the grouping variable 
\citep{mellenbergh1989item,kankaras2010testing,kankaras2011measurement}. Since we do not employ multiple groups (fixed effects) to deal with country effects, but a latent class multilevel (random effects) approach, instead of considering main and interaction effects from the countries directly, we consider these for the country random effects ($G$)  \citep[see][]{dejong2007relaxing,fox2011random}.
Thus, measurement invariance violations could be parameterized by extending Equation  \ref{eq:loglin-measurement} to include country group class ($g$) effects:
\begin{equation}
	\ln \omega_{k x g} = \tau_{k} + \lambda_{k x} + 
		\tau^{*}_{k g} + \lambda^{*}_{k x g}.
			\label{eq:loglin-measurement-noninvariant}
\end{equation}
The base invariance model above can then be seen as fixing the intercept deviations $\tau^{*}_{k g}$  and slope deviations $\lambda^{*}_{k x g}$ to 0.  An example of this parameterization of measurement non-invariance for 
the second ranking of Set C ($C_2$) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:model} as the dotted main effect and interaction effects for scalar and metric invariance, respectively. 

With three sets of three non-redundant ranking options each, there are $9 (S - 1) T$ possible additional $\tau^{*}_{k g}$ and $\lambda^{*}_{k x g}$ parameters representing misspecification in the full invariance model specified above. For example, with $S=3, T=3$, there will be $54$ possible violations of invariance. %With three or more second-level classes ($S \geq 3$), there are more possible violations of measurement invariance than there are parameters in the base model.
This is clearly a very large number of potential violations of measurement invariance, with an astronomical ($\approx 1.8 \times 10^{16}$) number of possible subsets of non-invariant models, making the fitting of each of these possible submodels infeasible. The EPC-interest, which considers the possible effect of freeing each of the restrictions separately, is therefore an attractive alternative. 

However, there are strong correlations between the possible additional parameters. First, parameters for different categories of the same variable will necessarily be strongly correlated. Second, parameters corresponding to the same ranking set (A, B, or C) will be highly correlated due to the necessary dependence between the first and second choice in a ranking task. Therefore, instead of considering only one possible misspecification at a time, we consider freeing sets of restrictions corresponding to all main effects and all interaction effects of each set. The advantages are that the estimated change in the parameters of interest will be closer to the observed change when freeing these restrictions, and that a model space to be explored of order $10^{16}$ is reduced to the examination of the effect of six sets of misspecifications on $2 (T-1)$  parameters of interest, $\gamma_{jx}$.

\bigskip
In summary, we have attacked the problem of examining the differences in (post)-materialism over 48 countries with different levels of GDP per capita and percentage of women in parliament by formulating a multilevel latent class model for ranking data. Measurement invariance is important here because direct main and interaction effects from country groups on the ranking tasks could threaten the comparison of countries with different levels of the covariates. Therefore it becomes relevant to examine the impact of these possible violations of measurement invariance on the parameters of substantive interest. The following section will introduce a method for doing so without the need to fit the alternative models. 


\section{EPC-interest}

In the application discussed, as in any application of invariance testing, interest focuses on a particular (function of) free parameters of the model. As argued by \citet{Oberski:WP:EPC-interest}, the question of invariance testing is then relevant insofar as it affects these parameters of interest. Such parameters may differ in models that allow for non-invariance, which in the model introduced in the previous section was parameterized as direct main and interaction effects of a group random effect. Instead of investigating whether such effects are statistically significantly different from zero, we suggest to investigate the impact of such effects on the parameters of interest. This  is done using the ``expected parameter change'' in the parameter of interest, ``$\da$''.

The ``$\da$'' estimates the change in a free parameter of the model that one can expect to observe if a particular restriction were freed. It is therefore a method of sensitivity analysis. However, the researcher is not forced to estimate all possible alternative models, but can evaluate the sensitivity of the results after fitting the restrictive full invariance model. 
The $\da{}$ is based on the work of \citet{saris_detection_1987}, who introduced the expected parameter change in a fixed parameter for linear structural equation models (SEM), and \citet{bentler1993some}, who introduced the expected parameter change in a free parameter after freeing a fixed parameter for SEM. \citet{Oberski:WP:EPC-interest} suggested using the $\da{}$ for invariance testing using linear structural equation models with continuous data.

In this section we apply the $\da{}$ to models with categorical observed and latent variables. We also extend the measure to evaluate the probable impact of several misspecifications at the same time. This last extension is particularly relevant in categorical data models, since parameters related to different categories of the same variable are often highly correlated. In such cases, the impact of misspecifications is better evaluated in sets of strongly related parameters. In the application to ranking data discussed above, for instance, parameters relating to the different ranking objects in the same set will be highly correlated, since the second choice in each ranking is modeled conditionally upon the first choice (Equation \ref{eq:ranking}). The impact of freeing the parameter $\lambda_{111}$ can therefore not be seen separately from that of $\lambda_{211}, \lambda_{121}$, etc. We therefore consider the impact of all possible interactions of country grouping $G$ with the latent postmaterialism variable $X$ jointly for each of the three ranking tasks. 

The key concept is considering the likelihood not only as a function of the free parameters of the model, but also as a function of the parameters that are fixed to obtain the full invariance model. Collecting the free parameters in a vector $\param$ and the fixed parameters in a vector $\bpsi$, we assume the likelihood can be written as an explicit function of both sets of parameters, $L(\param, \bpsi)$.  The maximum-likelihood estimates $\that$ of the free parameters can then be seen as obtained under the full invariance model that sets $\bpsi=0$, i.e. $\that = \arg\max_{\param} L(\param, \bpsi = 0)$. Further, define the parameters of substantive interest as $\vm{\pi} := \vm{P} \param$, where $\vm{P}$ is typically a logical (0/1) selection matrix, although any linear function of the free parameters $\param$ may be taken. 
Interest then focuses on the likely value these free parameters $\vm{\pi}$ would take if the fixed $\bpsi$ parameters were freed in an alternative model, $\hat{\vm{\pi}}_a = \vm{P} \arg\max_{\param, \bpsi} L(\param, \bpsi)$. 

We now show how these changes in the parameters of interest as a consequence of freeing the fixed parameters $\bpsi$ can be estimated without fitting the alternative model. Let the Hessian $\hat{\vm{H}}_{\vm{a}\vm{b}}$ be the matrix of second derivatives of the likelihood with respect to vectors $\vm{a}$ and $\vm{b}$, evaluated at the maximum likelihood solution of the full invariance model, $\hat{\vm{H}}_{\vm{a}\vm{b}} := (\partial^2 L /\partial \vm{a} \partial \vm{b}^\prime)|_{\param=\that}$. 
The expected change in the parameters of interest is then measured by the $\da$, 
\begin{equation}
\da = \hat{\vm{\pi}}_a - \hat{\vm{\pi}} = \vm{P}
%	\left( \frac{\partial^2 L(\param, \bpsi)}{\partial (\param, \bpsi)^\prime \partial (\param, \bpsi)} \right)^{-1}
%		\vm{D}^{-1} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi}^\prime \hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param}
\hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi}\vm{D}^{-1}
		\left[ \left.\frac{\partial L(\param, \bpsi)}{\partial \bpsi}\right|_{\param = \that} \right] +	
		O(\vm{\delta}^\prime\vm{\delta}),
		\label{eq:epc-interest}
\end{equation}
where $\vm{D}:= \hat{\vm{H}}_{\bpsi\bpsi} - \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi}^\prime \hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi}$ and the deviation from the true values is $\vm{\delta}:= \vm{\vartheta} - \hat{\vm{\vartheta}}$, with $\vm{\vartheta}$ collecting the free and fixed parameters in a vector, $\vm{\vartheta}:= (\param^\prime, \bpsi^\prime)^\prime$. Note that, apart from the order of approximation term $O(\vm{\delta}^\prime \vm{\delta})$,  Equation \ref{eq:epc-interest} contains only terms that can be calculated after fitting the invariance model. Thus, it is not necessary to fit the alternative model to obtain the $\da{}$.

In the structural equation modeling literature, the expected change in the fixed parameters $\bpsi$  is commonly found and implemented in standard SEM software. This measure is commonly know as the ``EPC'', but to avoid confusion we term it ``EPC-self'' here. The EPC-self and $\da{}$ both consider the impact of freeing restrictions, but differ in the target of this impact: the EPC-self evaluates the impact on the restriction itself, whereas the $\da{}$ evaluates the impact on the parameters of interest. In spite of these differences, the two measures are related: this can be seen by recognizing that $- \vm{D}^{-1}
		\left[ \left.\frac{\partial L(\param, \bpsi)}{\partial \bpsi}\right|_{\param = \that} \right] = \text{EPC-self} \approx \bpsi - \hat{\bpsi}$ so that, from Equation \ref{eq:epc-interest}, 
\begin{equation}
\da=- \vm{P} \hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi} \,\text{EPC-self} \approx
- \vm{P} \hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi} \left( \bpsi - \hat{\bpsi}\right)
\end{equation}
Furthermore, since $\hat{\bpsi}$ and $\hat{\param}$ are implicitly related by the fact that they are both solutions to the equation $\partial L / \partial \vm\vartheta = \vm{0}$, invoking the implicit function theorem yields $- \hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi}  = \partial \param / \partial \bpsi^\prime$, so that 
\begin{equation}
	\da = \vm{P} \left( \frac{\partial \param} {\partial \bpsi^\prime} \right) \left( \bpsi - \hat{\bpsi}\right),
	\label{eq:epc-linear}
\end{equation}
that is, the $\da{}$ can be seen simply as the coefficient of a linear approximation to the relationship between the free and fixed parameters, multiplied by the change in the fixed parameters. This demonstrates the difference with the sensitivity analysis approach common in econometrics \citep[p. 168]{magnus2007local} and applied to SEM by \citet{yuan2003assessing}, in which only $\partial \param / \partial \bpsi^\prime$ is considered: the $\da{}$ combines both the direction and the magnitude of the misspecification.


The derivation of the $\da{}$ given in Equation \ref{eq:epc-interest} starts from the full invariance solution. We then find a hypothetical new  maximum of the likelihood by setting the gradient of a Taylor expansion of the likelihood around the full invariance solution to zero:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial L(\param, \bpsi)}{\partial \vm{\vartheta}}= \vm{0} = 
	\left( \begin{array}{cc}
	\frac{\partial L(\param, \bpsi) }{ \partial \param}|_{\param=\that}\\
	\frac{\partial L(\param, \bpsi) }{ \partial \bpsi}|_{\param=\that}\\
	\end{array} \right)  + 
%	\left(\frac{\partial^2 L(\param, \bpsi) }{ \partial \vm{\vartheta}^\prime \partial \vm{\vartheta}} \right)
	\left( \begin{array}{cc}
		\hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\param} & \hat{\vm{H}}_{\bpsi\param}\\
		\hat{\vm{H}}_{\bpsi\param} & \hat{\vm{H}}_{\bpsi\bpsi}\\
	\end{array} \right)  
		\left( \begin{array}{cc}
		\param - \that\\
		\bpsi - \hat{\bpsi}
	\end{array} \right)+
O(\vm{\delta}^\prime\vm{\delta}).
	\label{eq:gradient}
\end{equation}
A similar device was used to derive the so-called ``modification index'' or ``score test'' for the significance of the hypothesis $\bpsi = \vm{0}$ by \citet[p. 373]{sorbom1989model}.
Equation \ref{eq:epc-interest}  follows directly by noting that $( \partial L(\param, \bpsi) / \partial \param ) |_{\param=\that} = \vm{0}$ and applying the standard linear algebra result on the inverse of a partitioned matrix $\left(\hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}\right)_{\param\bpsi} = 	- \hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi}\vm{D}^{-1}$ \citep[e.g.][p. 12]{magnus2007matrix}.

The accuracy of the approximation of the $\da{}$ as a measure of the change in the parameters of interest is reflected in the order of approximation term, $O(\vm{\delta}^\prime\vm{\delta})$. It can be seen that this accuracy is quadratic in the overall change in parameters, so that the approximation can be expected to work best when the misspecifications are not ``too large''. This result corresponds to results on the score test (``modification index'') and ``EPC-self'' in the literature on structural equation modeling, which can be shown to be exact under a ``sequence of local alternatives'', i.e. when $\vm{\vartheta} = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \hat{\vm{\vartheta}} + n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\vm{\delta}$ \citep[p. 135]{satorra1989alternative}.
It is important to note here that $\vm{\delta}$ is the deviation from the ``true'' value of $\vm{\vartheta}$, rather than the deviation from the limit of the parameter estimates under the alternative model. Therefore another view on the accuracy is that it will be better when the alternative model is not strongly misspecified. For this reason it is also important to consider freeing sets of very strongly related parameters simultaneously, since a change in one of them will then imply a change in the others, and, consequently, a misspecified alternative model.

%Applying standard theory of variance estimation in misspecified models \citep{white1982maximum}, this second-order term suggests that the variance of $\da{}$ can be estimated as
%\begin{equation}
%	\widehat{\text{avar}}(\da) = \vm{P} 		\vm{D}^{-1} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi}^\prime \hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param} 
%	\hat{\vm{B}}_{\bpsi\bpsi}
%\hat{\vm{H}}^{-1}_{\param\param} \hat{\vm{H}}_{\param\bpsi}	\vm{D}^{-1} \vm{P}^\prime,
%\end{equation}
%where $\hat{\vm{B}}_{\bpsi\bpsi}$ is the outer product matrix evaluated at the MLE. 

\subsection{EPC-interest for the multilevel latent class model}

The previous section discussed the rationale and derivation of the $\da{}$ for general maximum likelihood problems. For the application involving categorical latent and observed variables, $\bpsi$  corresponds to the direct effects $\tau^*_{jkg}$ and $\lambda^*_{jkxg}$ in Equation \ref{eq:loglin-measurement-noninvariant} (see also Figure \ref{fig:model}). The Jacobian of the individual likelihood with respect to the $\tau^*_{jkg}$ parameters is then
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial L_i(\param) }{\partial \tau^*_{jkg}} = 
		L_i(\param) \sum_G \left[ P(G) \sum_X P(X|Z_1, Z_2) ( Y_{jk}G_g - E[ Y_{jk}G_g | X]) \right],
		\label{eq:derivative-main}
\end{equation}
Similarly,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial L_i(\param) }{\partial \lambda^*_{jkxg}} = 
		L_i(\param) \sum_G \left[ P(G) \sum_X P(X|Z_1, Z_2) ( Y_{jk} X_x G_g  - E[ Y_{jk} X_x G_g | X]) \right],
		\label{eq:derivative-interaction}
\end{equation}
where $X_x$ is the effect-coded value for class $x$ of the within-country latent postmaterialism variable $X$.  Consistent estimates of all derivatives can be obtained by replacing the parameters of the model by their maximum likelihood estimates, providing the  vector $[ \left.\partial L(\param, \bpsi) / \partial \bpsi ] \right|_{\param = \that}$  necessary for calculating Equation \ref{eq:epc-interest}.


The Hessian matrix $\vm{H}$ 
The derivatives for other parameters of the model are given by  \citet{vermunt2013technical}. These have a form similar to Equations \ref{eq:derivative-main} and \ref{eq:derivative-interaction}.

\section{Results}


We now estimate the multilevel latent class model using 48 countries from the World Values Survey\footnote{\url{http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org}} for  2010--2012. \citet{moors2007heterogeneity} applied a similar model to 19 countries in the 1990 European Values Study data and investigated the relationship of the latent postmaterialism classes with political attitudes scales. However, they did not consider the possible impact of violations of measurement invariance on such estimates. Since our goal is to compare countries with different levels of GDP per capita and proportion of women in parliament, in this study we evaluate the sensitivity of these effect estimates of interest to measurement invariance assumptions using the $\da$.

The model elaborated in the previous sections as well as $\da{}$ measures for it are implemented by one of the authors in the software Latent Gold Choice version 5.0.0.14157 \citep[pp. 135--136]{vermunt2005lgchoice,vermunt2013technical}. Program input for this analysis can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:LGinput}, while output and data are included in the online Appendix at \url{http://[BLINDED]}.

\caption{Log-likelihood, number of parameters, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for models with different numbers of classes for the postmaterialism (within-country) and country group (between-country) latent class variables.\label{tab:loglikelihood-models}}
\end{table}

In choosing the number of classes for the postmaterialism (within-country) and country group (between-country) latent class variables, we follow the advice of \citet{lukovciene2010simultaneous} to first fix the number of country-group classes to unity and choose a number of within-country classes, subsequently fixing the number of within-country classes to this chosen number and determining the number of country-group (between-country) classes. The left-hand side of Table \ref{tab:loglikelihood-models} shows the log-likelihoods, number of parameters and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values based on the $L^2$ for the model with one country-group class and an increasing number of postmaterialism classes. It can be seen that the BIC, which penalizes model complexity, decreases with each additional latent postmaterialism class. In fact, the BIC does not stop decreasing even when incrementing the number of classes to 14 (not shown in Table \ref{tab:loglikelihood-models} for brevity). 

In the literature on postmaterialism \citep[e.g.][]{inglehart1997modernization,inglehart2002gender,inglehart2010changing}, the number of postmaterialism classes is typically fixed to three: ``postmaterialist'', ``materialist'', and ``mixed''. Clearly, using the WVS ranking tasks and imposing full invariance, many more qualitative postmaterialism classes can be distinguished than the traditional three classes. This corresponds to findings by \citet{moors2007heterogeneity}; however, these authors \citep[following][]{hagenaars1990categorical} also argued that ``one can safely interpret the results (...) if adding another class does not result in important changes of the latent class weights for the other classes'' (p. 637). While this is a somewhat subjective criterion, the three-class solution found in the data does correspond to  the theoretical ``postmaterialist'', ``materialist'', and ``mixed'' classes, whose  parameters appear to change little in the models with a greater number of classes. Moreover, the greatest reduction in BIC seen in Table \ref{tab:loglikelihood-models} takes place when moving from a one-class to a two-class model, with relatively small improvements after three or more classes. We therefore follow the theoretical literature in selecting the three-class model.

While selecting the number of country-group classes, we find that the BIC improves little after three classes (right-hand side of Table \ref{tab:loglikelihood-models}), so that our initial full invariance model has three postmaterialism (within-country) and three country group (between-country) classes. However, this full invariance model still imposes $\tau^*_{jkg} = 0$ and $\lambda^*_{jkxg} = 0$, i.e. there is no difference in measurement over the group random effect variable. Such violations of measurement invariance are relevant in the present analysis because they could potentially threaten the conclusions of substantive interest, namely the relationships $\gamma$ between postmaterialism on the one hand and GDP per capita and percentage of women in parliament on the other. 

We therefore calculated the $\da{}$ for these parameters, of which our three-class model has four: two for each for each of the two independent variables. Measurement invariance violations can potentially take the form of 6 direct main effects ($\tau^{*}_{j k g}$) --$(4-1)$ category effects in $(3-1)$ classes--  and 12 direct interaction effects ($\lambda^{*}_{j k x g}$) for each of the three ranking tasks, totaling 54 possible misspecifications in the full invariance model. However, these misspecifications are strongly correlated and should not be considered separately. Rather, we consider the probable impact on the $\gamma$ parameters of interest of freeing the direct main effects for each ranking task separately and of freeing the  direct interactions for each ranking task separately. In short, rather than consider the direct and interaction effects for each of the 48 countries on each of the 3 unique categories of each of the three ranking tasks, making for $4 \times 3 \times (4 - 1)\times  (48 - 1) \times(1 + (3 - 1)) = 5076$ potential $\da{}$ values, we evaluate direct effects of the country group random effect and consider their impact jointly for strongly correlated misspecifications, reducing the problem to 24 $\da{}$ values of interest.

\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:epc-interest-model1} shows these 34 $\da{}$ values calculated from the full invariance model. These $\da{}$ values estimate the likely change from the maximum likelihood estimates (column 3 in Table \ref{tab:epc-interest-model1}) in the four parameters of substantive interest after freeing the direct main or interaction effects for each of the three ranking tasks (columns 5--10 in  Table \ref{tab:epc-interest-model1}). In the full invariance model, Class 1 corresponds to a ``postmaterialism'' class. The estimate -0.035 (s.e. 0.007) shown in Table \ref{tab:epc-interest-model1}) would therefore suggest that more prosperous nations tend to be less postmaterialist. This directly contradicts the theory of \citet{inglehart1997modernization}, which suggests that this coefficient should be positive. 

Since the theory specifies only that certain coefficients should be positive or negative, the key focus of substantive interest should be whether misspecifications in the invariance model can potentially change the sign of a parameter of interest. In Table \ref{tab:epc-interest-model1}, we therefore look for $\da{}$ values that, when added to the estimates in column 3, would change the sign of those estimates. It can be seen in the Table that two such $\da{}$ are indeed present, namely the direct interaction effect of the country group class with the postmaterialism class on ranking tasks 1 and 2. The analogous finding \citep{kankaras2011measurement} if CFA had been used would be that of ``metric equivalence'' for ranking task 3 but not ranking tasks 1 and 2.  This means that the attribute parameters that define the classes for these two tasks differ over country groups, and that after accounting for these differences the effect of GDP on postmaterialism is estimated to be positive rather than negative. This set of misspecifications is thus of substantive interest and should be amended in the model. 

We therefore free these two sets of measurement invariance violations, allowing for differences in the parameters of ranking tasks 1 and 2 across country groups. Table \ref{tab:epc-interest-model2} shows the substantive parameter estimates and $\da{}$ interest values for the resulting partial invariance model, which has 63 parameters and a log-likelihood of $-418610.0$ ($\text{BIC} = 837920.5$). The likelihood ratio test of improvement in model fit is highly significant ($\chi^2_{\text{df} = 28} = 24607$). Moreover, the substantive logistic regression coefficient for the effect of GDP on the postmaterialism class (Class 2 in Table \ref{tab:epc-interest-model2}), is indeed positive after freeing the detected misspecifications. Re-calculating $\da{}$ values for the remaining possible misspecifications reveals that none of the possible misspecifications in this partial invariance model has the potential to change the substantive conclusions. In this sense, we therefore conclude that the partial invariance model fits ``approximately'', since none of the substantive conclusions based on it are threatened by measurement invariance violations.

The measurement parameters for the final model are shown in Table \ref{tab:attribute-parameters}. This table shows the sizes of the three postmaterialism classes (third row) and the ``attribute parameters'' $\lambda_{jkx}$, i.e. each class's difference from the average log-utility. It can be seen that for respondents in the first class, which is also the largest, the log-utility for the items ``economic growth'', ``order in the nation'', and ``stable economy'' is much larger than average. This class therefore clearly represents ``materialists'' who value economic considerations. The second class represents those for whom ``more say''  (set A), ``more say''  (set B), ``freedom of speech'', and ``humane society'' has a higher log-utility than average. This second class constituting about 21\% of the respondents is therefore labeled ``post materialist''. Finally, preferences in the third class are mostly toward the ``materialist'' items of sets B and C, but this class also includes people for whom ``more say'' is important when compared with a ``strong defense'' rather than when compared with ``rising prices''. Therefore we apply the label ``Mixed'' to this class.

This combination of classes corresponds to the labels and groups created  by \citet{inglehart1997modernization}. However, a key difference with the predefined groups of  \citet{inglehart1997modernization}  and the latent classes in the current model is that the latent classes here arise purely from the model and the response patterns observed in the data, rather than being imposed a priori. Crucially also, our model allows for measurement error in the ranking tasks.

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:covariates} summarizes the loglinear parameter estimates of interest shown column 3 of Table \ref{tab:epc-interest-model2}. These graphs plot the covariate level on the horizontal axes and the probability of belonging to each of the classes defined in Table \ref{tab:attribute-parameters} on the vertical axes. The left-hand plot in Figure \ref{fig:covariates} shows the estimated marginal relationship between the percentage of women in parliament and the postmaterialism classes. It can be seen that the probability of the ``post materialist'' class is much larger for countries with a large percentage of women in parliament than it is for countries for fewer female parliamentarians: the predicted probability of belonging to the postmaterialist class for countries with the observed maximum percentage of women in parliament is 0.30, which is 7 percentage points above the average ``postmaterialist'' class membership of 0.23 (shown in Table \ref{tab:attribute-parameters}). The probability of belonging to the purely economical ``materialist'' class also increases very slightly, to the overall detriment of membership of the ``mixed'' class in which ``order in the nation'' and ``fighting crime'' is sometimes endorsed. 

The right-hand side of Figure \ref{fig:covariates} plots the estimated effect of log-GDP per capita on the three class membership probabilities. A similar pattern to that for percentage of women in parliament is observed for the ``postmaterialist'' and ``mixed'' classes, while the probability of belonging to the ``materialist'' class decreases somewhat with GDP per capita. The differences in predicted class membership are even larger over the observed GDP range than for the percentage of women in parliament: the predicted postmaterialist class membership at the maximum observed GDP is 0.40, which is 17 percentage points above the average. Greater prosperity is thus clearly strongly associated with postmaterialism. 




\section{Discussion}


In summary, the present application of a multilevel latent class model to the WVS postmaterialism ranking tasks has shown how the $\da{}$ may be used to draw stable substantive conclusions when measurement invariance is a concern. Especially encouraging is the fact that the full invariance model provides estimates that contradict \citet{inglehart2010changing}'s values theory, whereas applying the procedure suggested here happens to yield estimates that corroborate it. This is not because we have adjusted the model to fit the theory but rather because freeing those misspecifications that could invalidate the conclusion  leads to this result. The $\da{}$ is a useful guide for this purpose, reducing a potentially 5076-dimensional problem to the examination of Tables \ref{tab:epc-interest-model1} and \ref{tab:epc-interest-model2}.
